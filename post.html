	<h3>Stunning, purpose driven, high performance websites</h3>
	
	<p>Our websites are custom designed and "built from scratch",
	to create an amazing user experience for your website users.
	We take a purpose based approach, working with you to first 
	understand your business objectives and to define what 'success 
	looks like' for you.<br><br>
	This gives us the background to create 
	meaningful user journeys, design points of engagement, articulate 
	CTAs and convert passive browses to active users. We have built
	everything from simple portfolio sites to enhanced eCommerce platforms 
	that have generated millions of US Dollars in online sales for
	customers. A great website drives engagement, performance and
	conversions; we endeavor to create a great website every time.<br><br>
	Deloitte found purpose-driven brands capture more market share and 
	grow on average three times faster than their competitors. They 
	also report 30% higher levels of innovation and 49% higher levels 
	of workforce retention.Generally, we can categorize the purpose of
	most websites into 3 sections: Awareness, sales, and information.<br><br>
	A purpose-driven organization can measure success through metrics
	such as social impact, employee engagement and satisfaction,
	customer loyalty and satisfaction, and financial performance.
	Success is not only measured by profit but also by the positive
	impact that the organization is making on society.<br><br>
Purpose helps organizations stand out and attract prospective employees, 
and boosts the retention of those who are already part of the team. 
Purpose-driven companies experience greater productivity, and their 
employees are more likely to invest their careers there.<br><br>	
When your staff connect with your purpose, and when their purpose 
and your purpose are the same, they'll feel more engaged and more
 involved in the workplace. This boosts staff motivation across 
 the business, to the point at which their motivation will be
 noticed by your customers.</p>
